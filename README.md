# statistics-reporter-typescript-tcdg

Web Application that loads data from a CSV format, parses it into a usable data structure, runs a statistical analysis and creates a report.

For example with a CSV data set from a season of football, you can create a report on how many games a team has played and how many wins they had out of those games.
